Ram Tokens (RAMT) is a premiere decentralized smart network on TRON (TRC 20)

Ram Tokens is bringing the global community together by building the worldâ€™s first crypto-based social media network with an ecosystem of decentralized apps powered by its deflationary token.

RAMT sets itself apart from other projects in the crypto-space by providing diverse utility to its deflationary token and incentivizing tokenomics which encourage users to hold it long term. In addition to passive rewards through token redistribution, RAMT holders will be able to receive perks and rewards on the Bonfire ecosystem under development proportional to how much Ram Tokens they hold. Token utility will be based around holding and not transacting. RAMT also has a large and dedicated community, which will help ensure each decentralized application has a large user base upon release
